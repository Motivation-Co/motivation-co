# [Motivation Co.](https://motivation-co.github.io/motivation-co/index.html)

Our attempt to make a fully functional website as a group by the end of Winter Break. The main theme of the website is Motivation, and the website will have multiple applications related to the theme.

[Website hosted through GitHub Pages](https://motivation-co.github.io/motivation-co/index.html)

## Learning Goals
